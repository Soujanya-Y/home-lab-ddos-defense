# Results

## 1. Summary of Results
- The simulated DDoS attacks were automatically detected and blocked by pfSense and Suricata.
- The internal target (Linux Mint) remained fully responsive with no packet reach.

## 2. Attack Outcomes

| Attack Type       | Blocked? | Detection Tool    | Notes                                  |
|-------------------|----------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| ICMP Flood        | Yes      | pfSense Firewall  | Block rule activated immediately       |
| TCP SYN Flood     | Yes      | Suricata (IPS)    | Alert shown; traffic dropped inline    |
| UDP Flood         | Yes      | pfSense Firewall  | UDP rule blocked the traffic           |

## 3. Evidence & Visuals

## 4. Observations
- Firewall rules captured the ICMP and UDP floods before Suricata had a chance to evaluate.
- Suricataâ€™s inline mode effectively intercepted the TCP SYN flood.
- No alerts or system load spikes detected on the target machine.
