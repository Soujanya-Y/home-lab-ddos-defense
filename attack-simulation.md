# Attack Simulation

## Objective

To simulate a basic Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack from an external network (Kali Linux) targeting an internal host (Linux Mint) through the pfSense firewall. This helps evaluate the firewall and Suricataâ€™s ability to detect and block malicious traffic.

## Attack Types Simulated

### 1. **ICMP Flood (Ping Flood)**

This attack floods the target with ICMP Echo Request packets (ping), consuming network resources.

**Command used:**

```bash

hping3 --icmp --flood -d 120 192.168.1.100
